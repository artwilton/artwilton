## Hi, I'm Arthur ðŸ‘‹

**I'm a software developer with a background in post production.**

Whether it's fine tuning the front-end performance of a web app, diving deep into an API's documentation, or writing bash scripts to automate manual processes, I love coming up with creative solutions to technical problems.
