## Hi, I'm Arthur ðŸ‘‹

**I'm a full stack developer with a background in media asset management.**



I love solving technical and creative problems and recently attended Flatiron School to gain skills in software development after many years of working in video production.

For more info feel free to contact me on **LinkedIn**, follow my blog posts on **Medium**, and check out my video production portfolio on **Behance**.
